Welcome to the **Headphones Landing Page** project — built as part of the ALX Front-End curriculum. This project demonstrates foundational web development techniques using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript** to bring a responsive and accessible user interface to life.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each step of the project builds on the previous, culminating in a fully functional landing page with animations and interactivity. The project is organized into stages, each with corresponding HTML, CSS (and eventually JS) files.

### 🧱 1. Header / Hero Section (`0-index.html`, `0-styles.css`)
- Establishes the structure and styling for the header and hero section.
- Best practices applied:
  - CSS reset
  - Use of variables
  - Simple, generic selectors
  - Modular HTML layout

### 💡 2. "What We Do" Section (`1-index.html`, `1-styles.css`)
- Introduces the services section with icon fonts (custom assets included).
- Emphasis on reusability for future sections.

### 📊 3. "Our Results" Section (`2-index.html`, `2-styles.css`)
- Reuses components for consistency.
- Highlights achievements visually.

### 📬 4. Contact Us Section (`3-index.html`, `3-styles.css`)
- Adds a contact form with optional field constraints and subtle animations.

### 🦶 5. Footer Section (`4-index.html`, `4-styles.css`)
- Finalizes the layout with a structured and accessible footer.

### 🖼️ 6. Code-Based Background Icons (`6-index.html`, `6-styles.css`)
- Removes image dependency for the “Our Results” background.
- Pentagons are built using **pure CSS shapes**.

### 💫 7. Animations (`7-index.html`, `7-styles.css`)
- Animations added to "What We Do" and "Our Results" sections.
- Includes transitions like scaling, opacity, and rotation on hover.

### 🍔 8. Hamburger Menu (`8-index.html`, `8-styles.css`, `8-script.js`)
- Introduces a mobile-first hamburger menu.
- Menu toggles open/close via **vanilla JavaScript** for screens ≤ 480px.
